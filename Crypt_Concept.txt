-use fgets for user input (pw, salt)
{SOLVED}

-double check user PW before accepting new entry

-write user PW to file as hash
{SOLVED}

-read hash from file -> get salt from hash -> compare hash from file with PW to grant access

-make buffers safe against overflow
{SOLVED}

-split programm into main file and func file

-free allocated memory!!!
{SOLVED}

-add error section
-check return value of file functions

-replace malloc with ecmalloc

-check PW and name length
{SOLVED}

-replace argv[1] with rndSalt

-write crName and crPW to file
{SOLVED}

-cut out '\n' from Pw and Name string

-2 problems in getPW():
	*fgets doesnt ask for second input
	*check does fail after second PW input
{SOLVED} --> clear stdin with getchar() in while-loops


-18characters input --> bug!
	*exactly 18 --> look at counter, '\0' and '\n'
{SOLVED} --> buff[19] in check label
	
-read for sha512:

-put crypt into own function with malloc, free mem afterwards, call crypt for second time
{SOLVED} --> crypt always gives back same pointer, got to delete buffer manually; no use in putting crypt into seperate function
